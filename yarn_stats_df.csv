<p>I fell in love with Targhee sheep and their crazy good wool years and years ago when I had loads of spinning time. It is as much a joy to spin as it is to knit. It&#8217;s so lofty that you expect it to just float away and it seriously could with the amount of elasticity it has. It might not be ultra soft like a very fine merino, but it&#8217;s still soft enough, and it will wear so very well. We have it in Bulky and Worsted for now as we see lots and lots of sweaters and outergarments in its future. Targhee Bulky is a four ply and the Worsted is a three ply.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Our Targhee is both raised and milled domestically. Targhee is one of America&#8217;s youngest breeds and is named after the National Forest where they grazed in the summer.

<p>ABOUT THE YARN: <br />DROPS Big Fabel, the amazingly soft and comfortable sock yarn!</p>

<p>The sequel to our DROPS Fabel yarn, spun in 4 strands of the same good quality, only thicker and in skeins of 100g. DROPS Big Fabel is a versatile yarn with a wide range of applications and superwash treated, which makes it machine washable and easy to care for. The yarn is spun with winter socks in mind, but is equally suitable for any other project.</p>

<p>DROPS Big Fabel comes in solid, printed and mouline colors. In the case of print colors, the yarn is made of various colors that repeat regularly in random lengths; and in the mouline version the thread consists of two different shades of yarn plied together.</p>

<p>The print colors in this yarn are dyed with a method called “fancy dyeing”, that differs from other methods in that each color party has small variations in both pattern and nuance. This is not an error, but an element of this yarn’s uniqueness.</p>

<p>The color samples show the pattern you get when you knit with a fewer amount of stitches, such as on socks. If you knit or crochet bigger garments the pattern will look different.</p>

<p>Made in the EU.</p>

<p>Spincycle Yarns is a two-woman operation established in 2004. Rachel and Kate produce luxurious yarns, hand-dyed and spun into small batches of perfection. This yarn is the product of a desire to merge the beauty and texture of a handspun yarn with a more efficiently produced millspun yarn. Spincycle Yarns collaborated with a nearby woman-owned and -operated fiber mill on Washington&#8217;s coast. This collaboration ensures that our yarn maintains the color artistry of the original handspun product. Because the fiber is dyed before it is spun, colors meet and part ways in stunning, unique combinations; the overall effect is of a balanced, seamless whole. Color changes are always brilliant, never repetitive. with yarn this fresh and exciting, you won&#8217;t be able to put your needles down.</p>

<p><strong>ABOUT THE YARN!</strong> <br />DROPS Eskimo is a soft, thick and easy to use single stranded yarn spun from 100% pure wool, that results in warm and comfortable garments, and it’s ideal for felting.</p>

<p>The fibers are untreated, which means that it is only washed and not exposed to any chemical treatment prior to the dyeing. This highlights the fiber’s natural properties, while it provides also a better shape and texture quality.</p>

<p>In addition to solid colors DROPS Eskimo also comes in mixed colors, printed colors, tweed-colors and degrade colors. <br />The mix colors are manufactured by carding the colors together before spinning. The printed colors means the yarn has various colors that regularly repeat in random lengths. Tweed-colors has tweed effects spun into the wool, that add both random colors and texture, and make the yarn vary a little in thickness. In the degrade colors there are even transitions from one color to next and when switching skeins in this Eskimo type it&#8217;s good to chose the end of the next skein starting with the same color repeat as last skein ended with. This way you will get a fancy result with pretty gradual transitions.</p>

<p><strong>ABOUT THE YARN:</strong> <br />DROPS Cotton Light is a lovely soft yarn in 50% cotton and 50% polyester micro. The micro fibers are thinner than silk strands and they do not take up moisture. This, combined with cotton, gives both summer and winter garments that breathe, have good shape stability and high durability.</p>

<p>DROPS Cotton Light is also the perfect yarn for children&#8217;s garments, as it is machine washable and comes in a wide variety of fun and vibrant colors. The yarn is spun from multiple strands which gives a smooth and even stitch definition.</p>

<p>DROPS Cotton Light is easily knitted and a great all-round yarn at a very competitive price. If you intend to use the yarn to crochet, note that the yarn tends to split due to the strands&#8217; smooth and silky character.</p>

<p>Made in EU.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This yarn has changed fiber content. The original <a href=""http://nordicmart.com/drops-cotton-light/"">DROPS Cotton Light</a> was 60% cotton, 40% acrylic. See the original yarn entry for more information. The greatest change is due to the change in quality. This gives the yarn a slight sheen that the old one lacks. It looks smoother and very different from before. It is not recommended to mix the old and the new Cotton Light yarns.</p>

<p>Depuis le printemps 2015, Gilliatt est fabriqué à partir d&#8217;un mélange exclusif de mérinos issus de la race MacoMérinos (env. 20 microns, Alpes du Sud), de mérinos d&#8217;Arles (env. 22 microns, Provence) et, selon les coloris, de mérinos Noir Pétra (env. 23 microns, Creuse et Portugal) pour un résultat à la fois doux, gonflant et durable.</p>

<p>Toutes les étapes de fabrication de ce fil sont réalisées en circuit court (Belgique ou Italie pour le lavage, France pour le filage, le retors et la teinture) avec une volonté constante de traçabilité et de réduction de son impact sur l&#8217;environnement.</p>

<p>Son gonflant naturel et la rondeur de sa structure en font un fil idéal pour tricoter d&#8217;incroyables torsades, du jersey douillet au kilomètre et tout ce qui donnerait envie de se blottir&#8230;</p>

<p>Il est proposé en couleurs naturelles issues du mélange des toisons brunes et blanches et dans une palette de coloris teints subtilement chinés.</p>

Buachaille is a 2-ply, worsted-spun(1) yarn, with a light, smooth hand, good stitch definition, and an attractive &#8220;halo&#8221;. It is a robust and highly versatile &#8220;woolly-wool&#8221;, and can be knit at tighter or looser gauges to suit a wide range of projects, from socks to shawls.</p>

We begin with three strands of the same lofty, woolen-spun Targhee-Columbia fleece, but rather than twisting the individual plies we nestle them together and gently spin the whole trio. The result is a plump yarn that looks like a single ply and has greater tensile strength and stitch definition than a true unspun yarn. Quarry has a soft and rustic hand; since we never subject our wool to harsh chemical scouring, you’ll find the occasional fleck of vegetable matter that remains as evidence of the sheep’s life on the Wyoming rangeland. The yarn’s one-directional twist may cause it to twirl between the needles and the ball while you’re knitting, but the fabric will be well balanced with no biasing. Quarry knits will bloom to become cohesive and supple after a wet blocking. You shouldn’t notice any change in gauge. This yarn loves to cable and beautifully renders all kinds of textural stitch work. Despite its soft structure, it can be worked at looser gauges without loss of integrity to the fabric. We think it’s ideal for sweaters, coats, blankets, and cozy accessories.</p>

<p>Quarry is offered in a new palette of ten heathered colors. The structure of this yarn blends the hues in a slightly striated way, reminding us of geological formations, so we gave each color the name of a mineral or gemstone.</p>

<p><em>Quince &amp; Company Kestrel is a new take on a simple linen yarn. We took the same Belgium-grown organic linen that we use in our little Sparrow and spun it this time in a ribbon structure. Kestrel knits up quickly at 3 ½ to 4 stitches to the inch. Its flat surface adds a slight texture to simple knit and purl stitches. But we think the best thing about it is its incredible drape. Like all things linen, woven or knitted, Kestrel only gets better as you wash and wear it.</em></p>

<p>From Schoolhouse Press:</p>

<p>&#8220;Extraordinary long-fibered fleece unique to Icelandic sheep produce the warmest wool we know of. Work from a single wheel for 1- or 2-ply; or from 2 wheels for 3- or 4-ply. Natural shades. 3 1/2-oz. wheel, 300 yards, single strand: 6 to 7 to 8 sts to 1 inch; 2- ply—3-1/2 to 4 sts to 1 inch.&#8221;</p>

<p>Per handout with yarn:</p>

<p>&#8220;This untwisted, natural-colored wool from the hardy Icelandic sheep knits up easily directly from the &#8216;wheel&#8217; into garments of great strength and beauty. Pull the wool gently from the center of the wheel for one-ply, or from the center and the outside together for two-ply.</p>

<p>Use a light hand when pulling the wool from the wheel until the center hole is large enough to permit the wool to flow freely. If the strand should break, simply overlap the ends, moisten your palm, and rub the two strands together for a &#8216;spit-splice&#8217;. This also works for joining a new wheel - and no ends to darn in.</p>

<p>The versatility of this splendid stuff is extraordinary: we have used 1-ply for lace shawls on huge needles at a gauge of about 2 stitches to 1&#8221;, as well as the Swedish Dubblemossa at 6.5 to 1&#8221;, and the &#8216;Scarf/Hat&#8217; at 4 sts to 1&#8221;. In 2-ply, you may produce wonderfully warm sweaters, jackets, hats or coats; and we have an amazing garter-stitch afghan worked in 4-ply by knitting from inside and outside of two wheels sitting side-by-side&#8221;.</p>

<p>DROPS Delight is a single stranded yarn, made with superwash treated wool and strengthened with polyamide. An exciting and machine washable yarn that you can use for much more than just socks! Try it on larger projects like cardigans, jumpers, scarves and accessories.</p>

<p>The colorful &#8220;magic print&#8221; creates fantastic color combinations. The yarn features smooth color transitions and has a nice handspun &#8220;thick and thin&#8221; texture. The &#8220;magic print&#8221; provides unique patterns and color transitions, which means that within one dye lot, lighter or darker varieties might appear. This is no fault or defect, but part of the yarn&#8217;s character.</p>

<p>The sample pictures in the shade card show the yarn&#8217;s color transitions when knitting a small garment, such as socks. On bigger pieces the look of the shade will be different.</p>

<p>This yarn is true to its name … “Flauschig” means something like “fluffy, soft, cuddly” in Swiss-German.</p>

<p>It has been worsted spun in two plies from equal parts of silk and merino, a truly luxurious mix that will prove to be your workhorse yarn, suitable for a wide range of both garments and accessories like shawls, hats or even gloves.</p>

<p>Siide-Flauschig is warm and soft enough to wear next to your skin, but also has quite some strength and luster, provided by the silk. Though it is labeled as worsted weight, it could also be used in the DK and even the Aran weight range, depending on the characteristics of the fabric you aim at.</p>

<p>Each single skein of this wonderful yarn has been hand-dyed by us in small batches of ten, with utmost care for the fiber and a true love for beautiful colours. Most of the current colours are in the semi-solid to almost-solid range, some few colourways could be defined as slightly variegated.</p>

<p>Our dyeing technique results in colours changes that are not prone to pooling at all. For larger projects though, as with all hand-dyed yarns, we recommend to introduce a new skein while still knitting with the old one – this way, possible slight colour differences from one skein to the other will not be noticeable.</p>

<p>The merino is not super-wash treated, so we recommend hand-washing with good quality yarn wash, as we do for all our yarns.</p>

<p>How to care for our wool and wool blends: <br />We recommend that you hand wash your wool project with gentle soap, such as Twig &amp; Horn&#8217;s lanolizing Wool Soap, in cool water. If using a gentle soap such as Wool Soap, you do not have to rinse. If you use a regular detergent, rinse it thoroughly and gently press out extra water and roll it lightly in a terry towel to absorb more of the moisture. Lay your project out to the correct measurements and let it dry naturally. If you want to speed up drying, aim a fan at the drying surface.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;d like to try machine washing your wool and wool-blend garments (not recommended), use cool water and a gentle cycle. After spinning, lay your garment flat to dry. And never, never put your knitted wool garment in the dryer.</p>",,quince--co-lark,4.7,1411,6637,smooth,,134,1,5,4.5,8650,12,,3723,6223,42,"Page created: July  9, 2010Last updated: February 26, 2016…"

<p>You can keep the kinks and have a really cool texture. To maintain them, handle FO gently after soaking, supporting its weight and lay flat to dry. To block out the kinks, just block it as you would anything else.</p>

<p>How to care for our wool and wool blends: <br />We recommend that you hand wash your wool project with gentle soap, such as Twig &amp; Horn&#8217;s lanolizing Wool Soap, in cool water. If using a gentle soap such as Wool Soap, you do not have to rinse. If you use a regular detergent, rinse it thoroughly and gently press out extra water and roll it lightly in a terry towel to absorb more of the moisture. Lay your project out to the correct measurements and let it dry naturally. If you want to speed up drying, aim a fan at the drying surface.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;d like to try machine washing your wool and wool-blend garments (not recommended), use cool water and a gentle cycle. After spinning, lay your garment flat to dry.

<p>Another great Swiss spun and hand-dyed yarn brought to you by Siidegarte yarns! We&#8217;re proud to introduce Siide-Fideel!</p>

<p>This is a worsted spun yarn, three plies (which makes it perfect for any lace projects as well) from equal parts of silk and merino.</p>

<p>This yarn lends itself to so many great projects, like all those beautiful fingering-weight shawls that are so abundant right now. You could even knit a pair of socks of this sock-weight yarn, though we wouldn&#8217;t advise you to wear those while trecking &#8230; these would be more of your luxurious, loungy footwear.</p>

<p>As always, our names come from our version of Swiss-German: &#8220;Fideel&#8221; means &#8216;cheerful&#8221;, &#8216;funny&#8217; and &#8216;pleasing&#8217; &#8230; again, the perfect name for this delightful yarn!</p>

<p>Each single skein of this wonderful yarn has been hand-dyed by us in small batches of ten, with utmost care for the fiber and a true love for beautiful colours. Like with most of our yarns, the current colours are in the semi-solid to almost-solid range, some few colourways could be defined as slightly variegated. As this is such a spring-like yarn, lending itself to warmer-weather projects, we&#8217;ve kept the first few colourways in a light colour, adding a few neutrals in the greyisch and fawn range to make combining colours easier.</p>

<p>Our dyeing technique results in colours changes that are not prone to pooling at all. For larger projects though, as with all hand-dyed yarns, we recommend to introduce a new skein while still knitting with the old one – this way, possible slight colour differences from one skein to the other will not be noticeable.</p>

<p>The merino is not super-wash treated, so we recommend hand-washing with good quality yarn wash, as we do for all our yarns.</p>

<p>This yarn is available for custom orders: if you have any special requirements regarding yardage, number of same dyelot skeins or even colour, please do contact us</p>",,siidegarte-siide-fideel,4.74,69,327,plyed,,525,4,28,26,13473,5,,213,222,2,"Page created: January 16, 2014Last updated: March 19, 2015…"

<p><strong>ABOUT THE YARN:</strong> <br />DROPS Alpaca Bouclé is a lovely soft effect yarn spun in alpaca. The yarn fibers are untreated, which means that they are only washed and not exposed to any chemical treatment prior to the dyeing. This highlights the fiber’s natural properties, while it also provides a better shape and texture quality.</p>

<p>“Bouclé” is the French word for a loop and it refers to the number of small loops of pure alpaca that give the ball its characteristic look. Spun from 2 strands, the core is a blend of wool and nylon, which helps give the yarn strength, and the combination of alpaca and bouclé provides a super soft yarn with excellent performance and a fantastic effect. Garments made in DROPS Alpaca Bouclé are light and fluffy.</p>

<p>DROPS Alpaca Bouclé contains some mixed colours, this means the wool is manufactured by carding the colours together before spinning, which gives it a mix effect.</p>

<p>Only Oeko-Tex certified dyes are used.</p>

<p>How to care for our wool and wool blends: <br />We recommend that you hand wash your wool project with gentle soap, such as Twig &amp; Horn&#8217;s lanolizing Wool Soap, in cool water. If using a gentle soap such as Wool Soap, you do not have to rinse. If you use a regular detergent, rinse it thoroughly and gently press out extra water and roll it lightly in a terry towel to absorb more of the moisture. Lay your project out to the correct measurements and let it dry naturally. If you want to speed up drying, aim a fan at the drying surface.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;d like to try machine washing your wool and wool-blend garments (not recommended), use cool water and a gentle cycle. After spinning, lay your garment flat to dry. And never, never put your knitted wool garment in the dryer.</p>",,quince--co-finch,4.74,733,3477,,,221,1,9,7,8650,5,,2968,2791,16,"Page created: November 17, 2011Last updated: February 26, 2016…"

<p><strong>ABOUT THE YARN:</strong> <br />DROPS Lace is a premium blend of 70% baby alpaca and 30% mulberry silk, spun into a 2 strands yarn with a generous length of about 400 meters per skein.</p>

<p>The fibers used in the composition of DROPS Lace are untreated, which means that they are only washed and not exposed to any chemical treatment prior to the dyeing. This highlights the fibers’ natural properties, while it provides also a better shape and texture quality.</p>

<p>DROPS Lace is a lace yarn at its very best: delicately fine and incredibly soft, which makes it perfect for creating lightweight shawls, wraps, and scarves with intricate and decorative motifs. While the suggested tension is small, most lace patterns recommend a much larger needle or hook size so that the lace really stands out. Tension in lace depends on how open or lacy a fabric you want, so the needle/hook size can vary.</p>

<p>DROPS Alpaca is a lovely yarn spun from 100% alpaca. The alpaca fiber is untreated, which means that it is only washed and not exposed to any chemical treatment prior to the dyeing. This highlights the fiber’s natural properties, while it also provides a better shape and texture quality.</p>

<p>This quality is spun from 3 strands with an extra twist to provide a durable surface, and it’s available in many colors, from the vibrant to the more subdued. Solid, uncolored eco, natural and mixed tones. The last are manufactured by carding the colors together before spinning, which gives it a mix effect.</p>

<p>DROPS Alpaca has a large, comprehensive and varied range of patterns available in the DROPS collection. Garments made in this yarn are lightweight and comfortable, super soft directly on the skin, and have a nice characteristic sheen.</p>

<p><strong>ABOUT THE YARN:</strong> <br />DROPS Nepal is a lovely, chunky and luxurious yarn spun in 35% alpaca and 65% wool. The fibers are untreated, which means that they are only washed and not exposed to any chemical treatment prior to the dyeing. This highlights the fibers’ natural properties, providing also a better shape and texture qualities.</p>

<p>The mix accentuates the softness of alpaca and the wool contributes to the garments’ shape stability. The quality is spun from 3 strands which gives an exciting and rustic stitch definition. DROPS Nepal is an easily knitted/crocheted quality and is also ideal for felting. The felted garments have an even and soft surface.</p>

<p>DROPS Nepal contains mixed colors, this means the wool is manufactured by carding the colors together before spinning, which gives it a mixed effect.</p>

<p>How to care for our wool and wool blends: <br />We recommend that you hand wash your wool project with gentle soap, such as Twig &amp; Horn&#8217;s lanolizing Wool Soap, in cool water. If using a gentle soap such as Wool Soap, you do not have to rinse. If you use a regular detergent, rinse it thoroughly and gently press out extra water and roll it lightly in a terry towel to absorb more of the moisture. Lay your project out to the correct measurements and let it dry naturally. If you want to speed up drying, aim a fan at the drying surface.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;d like to try machine washing your wool and wool-blend garments (not recommended), use cool water and a gentle cycle. After spinning, lay your garment flat to dry. And never, never put your knitted wool garment in the dryer.</p>",,quince--co-osprey,4.77,1082,5158,smooth,,170,1,4,3.5,8650,1,,2168,4162,22,"Page created: July  9, 2010Last updated: February 26, 2016…"

<p>DROPS Merino Extra Fine is cable spun from 100% merino wool fibers (19,5 micron)from free-range animals in South Africa and South America. The yarn is spun from multiple thin strands, which gives extra elasticity, and this special construction makes it extra important to treat the garment right: Make sure that you knit with the correct gauge and rather use a tight gauge, than too loose. Don&#8217;t wash your garment too warm and never leave it to soak. Let the garment dry flat.</p>

<p>Garments made in this yarn are very comfortable and have a great surface quality. DROPS Merino Extra Fine is gentle on the skin, and therefore great for baby and children’s garments.</p>

<p>DROPS Merino Extra Fine is ideal for textured patterns such as cables and seed stitch. Work rather tight than too loose. The yarn is superwash treated and machine washable, and suitable for everyday use.</p>

<p>DROPS Merino Extra Fine contains mixed colors, this means the wool is manufactured by carding the colors together before spinning, which gives it a mixed effect.</p>

<p>DROPS Paris is spun from multiple thin strands of 100% cotton - a fiber that breathes and has a high absorbency, which makes garments made in this yarn cool and yet warm.</p>

<p>Soft to the touch and with a delicate rustic feel, this yarn is available in two different types; DROPS Paris uni colour, made from 100% combed cotton and DROPS Paris recycled denim, made from 100% recycled cotton.</p>

<p>In both cases, this is a yarn that works up fast and easy, and it’s a great choice for beginners and for interior projects like potholders, dish cloths, towels and baby bibs; being especially good for people with sensitive skin, since it does not itch or irritate.</p>

<p>The inspiration for this yarn came from canoeing through the watershed in Harrisville, New Hampshire. The water bubbles up from natural springs, flowing from the top at Spoonwood Pond down to the bottom at Lake Skatutakee. The names for each color were derived from various things I observed along the rivers, lakes, and stream as I paddled along. The color blends were designed to replicate the essence of the objects for which they are named. Water is the reason our village was established here. Every day the river brings more water, power, and life through our mill. Our watershed is an endless source of life and natural beauty. I hope you enjoy the yarn as much as we enjoyed spinning it.</p>

<p><strong>Information from their website:</strong> <br />&#8220;Marr Haven Fine Grade Wool Yarn comes from our Merino-Rambouillet sheep; you can feel and see the luxurious softness.

All Marr Haven yarn is mule spun to keep the natural elasticity of fine wool.&#8221;</p>

<p>Marr Haven Wool Yarn will take wool dyes beautifully; the Light Grey and Medium Grey will give a deeper richness to a color. The natural processing of our yarn allows it to felt as well, no bleaches are added so the Natural (off-white) does felt.</p>

<p>Only premium wool is sent for cleaning. The cleaning process used on our wool is called &#8220;scouring&#8221;; using only soap, water and salt. Many wools are cleaned by &#8220;carbonizing&#8221;, using an acid process which burns up bits of hay chaff while cleaning the wool. Some wools are bleached as well, ours is not. We believe the scouring process, which retains some lanolin, is kind to the wool fibers and to the wearer of the finished garment.</p>

<p>If we want &#8220;LIGHT GREY&#8221; yarn, 10% natural colored dark wool is blended with the white wool during carding. &#8220;MEDIUM GREY&#8221; yarn is 40% natural colored dark wool blended with white wool. The &#8220;NATURAL&#8221; is just that; natural white color, cleaned naturally.</p>

<p>The same fine-grade wool is used for our Heather Colors; the shearing, skirting and scouring process is the same. The natural wool is blended with dyed wool to make the Heather Colors.

<p>How to care for our wool and wool blends: <br />We recommend that you hand wash your wool project with gentle soap, such as Twig &amp; Horn&#8217;s lanolizing Wool Soap, in cool water. If using a gentle soap such as Wool Soap, you do not have to rinse. If you use a regular detergent, rinse it thoroughly and gently press out extra water and roll it lightly in a terry towel to absorb more of the moisture. Lay your project out to the correct measurements and let it dry naturally. If you want to speed up drying, aim a fan at the drying surface.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;d like to try machine washing your wool and wool-blend garments (not recommended), use cool water and a gentle cycle. After spinning, lay your garment flat to dry. And never, never put your knitted wool garment in the dryer.</p>",,quince--co-piper,4.78,100,478,singles,,305,1,7,6,8650,7,,385,349,5,"Page created: June  5, 2014Last updated: February 26, 2016…"

<p><strong>ABOUT THE YARN:</strong> <br />A delicate yarn for all seasons!</p>

<p>DROPS Cotton Merino is spun from high quality merino wool and the softest, finest cotton. Together, these two popular fibers create a superb combination of properties in terms of softness, fullness and elasticity, resulting in very comfortable garments where the stitches are clearly defined, and the result is neat and even. The yarn is soft on the skin, which makes it specially suitable for children and baby clothing.</p>

<p>DROPS Cotton Merino is cable spun from multiple threads to achieve roundness and fullness which also gives the yarn extra elasticity making it great to work with. It is particularly suitable for structure patterns, cables and moss stitch. As in all our merino yarns, the merino wool comes from free-range animals in South Africa and South America.</p>

<p>The wool on this yarn is superwash treated, which makes it good for daily use as it is machine washable.</p>

<p>Made in EU. This yarn has Oeko-Tex® certification.</p>

<p>We sought to find an American fleece whose fiber would bring both softness and durability to the table. The Targhee-Columbia cross mixes a high-crimp Targhee Finewool (21-25 microns) for softness and elasticity with an all-purpose Columbia Mediumwool (24-30 microns) that provides warmth, structure and strength.</p>

<p>The result? A distinctive wool with a story to tell -- designed, sourced and produced completely on American soil.</p>

<p>The distinctive character of Targhee-Columbia wool shines in our versatile medium-weight yarn. Shelter is woolen spun, meaning the fibers remain in a lofty jumble that traps air and offers remarkable warmth and lightness. Its two plies are gently twisted to preserve that buoyant quality, so Shelter is a little more delicate than most commercial yarns. Woolen-spun yarns are also more adaptable in gauge, as they can compress to a dense sport weight or bloom to cohere as a gauzy fabric when worked on large needles. Shelter has a dry, soft hand and a faintly rustic nature; woolen spinning sometimes results in slightly thinner or thicker sections, and you’ll find the occasional fleck of vegetable matter that proves our wool is never treated with harsh chemicals. Garments knit from Shelter achieve their full beauty after a wet blocking, as each stitch relaxes and bonds with its neighbors to produce an even, light, plush fabric with a halo. You shouldn’t notice any change in gauge. Shelter is designed to be a workhorse yarn that invites cables, ribbing, textured stitch motifs, open work, plain stockinette and garter stitch. We think it’s ideal for sweaters of every variety, winter accessories, and blankets.</p>

<p>SHELTER is spun in Harrisville, NH -- an historic mill town where woolen-spun yarns have been produced for weavers and knitters since 1794.</p>

<p>Globally speaking, we think that knitters should be able to procure wools of high-quality that directly support farmers, mills, and designers from our own back yard, which has been our goal from day one.</p>

<p>Titus is stunning, luxurious natural 4 ply yarn that blends the beautiful long locks of the Wensleydale in a natural grey shade with the finest of all British Breeds, the Bluefaced Leicester, and then added another little Yorkshire surprise which gave the inspiration for its name.</p>

<p>Sir Titus Salt was a Yorkshire born wool manufacturer who became fed up with the smoke and pollution emanating from the mills and factory chimneys and decided to build a new mill on the outskirts of Shipley town. He opened his mill in 1853, and soon after houses, bathhouses, an institute, hospital, almshouses and churches were built for its workers, which became the village of Saltaire, now a World Heritage Site and well worth a visit if you haven&#8217;t been.</p>

<p>But this wasn&#8217;t Sir Titus&#8217; only achievement. In 1836, Titus came upon some bales of Alpaca in a warehouse in Liverpool and, after taking some samples away to experiment, came back and bought the consignment. Although he wasn&#8217;t the first person in England to work with the fibre, he was the creator of the lustrous and subsequently hugely fashionable cloth called &#8216;alpaca&#8217;, which contributed massively to his success as a manufacturer.</p>

If you use a regular detergent, rinse it thoroughly and gently press out extra water and roll it lightly in a terry towel to absorb more of the moisture. Lay your project out to the correct measurements and let it dry naturally. If you want to speed up drying, aim a fan at the drying surface.</p>

Since the angora in the yarn blooms quite a bit once blocked, it is able to be knit at the worsted weight and fill in the space nicely.

<p><strong>Bernat Cotton-ish by Vickie Howell</strong> (just Cotton-ish, for short), is a lightweight, 55% cotton/45% acrylic blend with a tight twist to give it a spring-y hand. It&#8217;s lovely, airy drape is perfect for a variety of items including baby layette, toddler clothing, women&#8217;s tops, lacy shawls, summer beanies, cafe curtains and placemats.</p>

<p>Cotton-ish comes in the rich, saturated colors that are signature to my modern-meets-retro-chic aesthetic. While creating this line, I took to heart the frequent requests I get from mom stitchers who are sick of traditional pastels for babies. Whether you&#8217;re making something for infant, adult or home, the palette of this line speaks to the trend of mixing bold color with cool neutrals. Each color was hand-picked by me -- using everything from fabric to found objects as inspiration -- and named after something cotton-related (you know how I love a theme!)</p>

<p><strong>ABOUT THE YARN:</strong> <br />DROPS Polaris is a single strand yarn, spun in the same soft wool as DROPS Eskimo. The wool fibers are unprocessed, which means that they are only washed and not exposed to any chemical treatment prior to the dyeing. This highlights the fiber&#8217;s natural properties, providing also a better shape and texture qualities.</p>

<p>DROPS Polaris is specially good for outerwear garments, such as hats, scarves, bags and ponchos. Knits quickly and with the same gauge as DROPS Eskimo held double.</p>

<p>DROPS Polaris contains mixed colors, this means the wool is manufactured by carding the colors together before spinning, which gives it a mixed effect.</p>

<p><strong>ABOUT THE YARN:</strong> <br />DROPS Andes is spun from 2 strands in the traditional combination of 65% wool and 35% alpaca. The mixture brings out the alpaca silky surface, while the wool helps to have a better shape stability. The yarn fibers are untreated, which means that it is only washed and not exposed to any chemical treatment prior to the dyeing. This highlights the fiber’s natural properties, while it also provides a better shape and texture quality.</p>

<p>DROPS Andes contains some mixed colors, which means the wool is manufactured by carding the colors together before spinning, which gives it a mixed effect.</p>

<p>DROPS Andes is very easy to work with thick needles and hooks, and it is ideal for felting.</p>

<p><strong>MORE ABOUT THE YARN:</strong> <br />Hard wearing as only a sock yarn can be! Compared to other sock yarns using a rougher wool, DROPS Fabel is spun in a softer wool quality. This makes it an amazing all-round yarn, suitable for far more than socks - try it for baby garments!</p>

<p>DROPS Fabel is a 4 stranded yarn and is superwash treated, which makes it machine washable and easy to care for. Available in solid, mouline and printed colors, the last being produced with a method called “fancy dyeing” that differs from other methods in that each dye lot has small variations in both pattern and nuance. This is not an error, but an element of the yarn’s character.</p>

<p>The knitted color samples displayed on the shade card show the pattern you get when you knit with a fewer amount of stitches, as on socks. If you make a wider piece, the pattern will look different. As with all jacquard-prints there may be differences in color shades and pattern within the same dye lot.</p>

Chugiak is a tight enough twist that you can substitute it for lace weight in some projects.  Did we tell you about the color?  Pagewood Farm colorways absolutely “POP” in our Chugiak.  Something about the absorption rate of the 100% merino makes the colors deeper, richer and more vibrant. 450-yard skeins enough for a full pair of socks.   Washable (hand wash or machine wash gentle cycle.)</em></p>

<p>From <a href=""http://www.knitpicks.com/Felici%20Self%20Striping%20Sock%20Yarn_YD5420165.html"">Knitpicks</a>:</p>

<p>Felici is a play on the Italian word for &#8220;happy&#8221; and &#8220;glad&#8221; - your feet will be dancing with joy! The superwash Merino is 19.5 microns (layman&#8217;s translation: super-duper soft). The nylon lends strength and durability to the wool, making it suitable for the constant wear socks get. And the machine washability means you will be wearing them constantly. The fun four-color sequenced stripes also have varying widths so a full repeat takes about four inches of stockinette in an average adult sock size. You could also try textured or lace patterns to add another dimension to the waves of color. From subtly tonal stripes to neon brights, this yarn will keep you eagerly anticipating the next color change. Have fun playing with the stripes in other small projects like hats, mittens and baby clothes.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Each Felici colorway is a limited edition. Colors will be retired after they sell out. The newer colorways have six stripes (two sections of three stripes each). Each stripe is about 1/2&#8221; wide, for a total repeat of about 3&#8221; in an average adult size sock. The older colorways that are now on clearance have five alternating stripes each about 1/2&#8221; wide, for a total repeat of 2.5&#8221; in an average adult size sock.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> For the first incarnation of Felici only: If you want the stripes to match across a pair of socks, make sure to check the stripe sequence when you start. Each color appears twice in the sequence, and each appearance is a different width. It is really a lot of fun to let the stripes work up randomly for each sock.</p>",,knit-picks-felici,4.44,3472,15412,plied,,218,4,32,28,96,5,,23619,20561,90,"Page created: July  1, 2007Last updated: June 17, 2015…"

Linen adds the characteristic flecks and additional absorbency with very low elasticity - helping to alleviate stretching in the finished knit.

<p>Provence, one of our signature yarns, is a mercerized Egyptian cotton that knits into a strong and beautiful fabric. Egyptian cotton has two qualities that make it a great cotton yarn: a very long staple (fiber) length and a small diameter. The long staple gives the yarn strength and sheen; and the delicate diameter means that it spins into a soft, smooth yarn. Mercerizing makes a yarn that is stable, takes dye well, and is less likely to shrink.</p>

<p>Provence is perfect for all of your warmer weather garments and accessories. The generous yardage makes this yarn go a long way.</p>

<p><strong>ABOUT THE YARN:</strong> <br />DROPS BabyAlpaca Silk is spun from 3 strands in a combination of the best of two wonderful fibers, being a mix of 70% baby alpaca (for the softness) and 30% mulberry silk (for strength and glossy shine). The yarn fibers are untreated, which means they are only washed and not exposed to any chemical treatment prior to the dyeing. This highlights the fiber’s natural properties, while it also provides a better shape and texture quality.</p>

<p>DROPS BabyAlpaca Silk is great for baby garments. It is soft against the skin, cooling when hot and warm when cold.</p>

<p>From their website:</p>

<p>We take great pride in our flock of Beaverslide Merino sheep, grown under wholesome and humane conditions. Our animals live in an essentially extreme climate, so their wool is noticeably “loftier” than that which is imported.</p>

<p>…We have…been to the mill in Canada many times and can assure you that it is environmentally responsible and produces quality products the old-fashioned way. The wool is processed naturally, in contrast to larger mills, which often treat the wool with harsh chemicals to dissolve vegetable matter, mothproof or superwash. It is also non-carbonized (not heated to extremely high temperatures to destroy plant matter). Wool doesn’t burn, but carbonizing apparently alters its molecular structure and creates a harsh product. In an effort to avoid this over-processing, a few flecks of straw remain in the product, but are easily removed as you knit.</p>

<p>The yarn is “mulespun”; mule spinning gives yarns characteristics all their own. The draw allows for a more uniform product, and the relaxation of the tension allows the yarn to “fluff up” more. Many experts consider the mule to make the very highest quality of handwork yarns.</p>

<p>We offer 47 selections of 2-ply worsted weight yarn. It knits to a gauge of approximately 4.5 to 5 stitches to the inch on size 6 or 7 needles. It is 90% fine Beaverslide wool and 10% kid mohair. The fine, kid mohair adds a soft sheen and enriches the color, without the scratchiness associated with mohair. There are approximately 241 yds. per 4 oz. skein. Included in this line are muted heathers, solids and 7 &#8220;all natural&#8221; choices.</p>",FALSE,beaverslide-dry-goods-merino-mohair-90-10,4.61,305,1405,plied,,241,4,20,18,340,12,,892,1275,28,"Page created: May  3, 2007Last updated: September 24, 2011…"

<p><strong>ABOUT THE YARN:</strong> <br />DROPS Big Merino is the sequel to DROPS Merino Extra Fine, spun from 100% merino wool fibers (19,5 micron) from free-range animals in South Africa and South America.</p>

<p>The main characteristics of DROPS Big Merino are the softness, volume, elasticity and even result, which makes it ideal for knitting structured patterns such as cables. The yarn is also superwash treated and therefore machine washable and suitable for everyday use.</p>

<p>The yarn is spun from multiple thin strands, which gives extra elasticity, and this special construction makes it extra important to treat the garment right: Make sure that you knit with the correct gauge and rather use a tight gauge, than too loose. Don&#8217;t wash your garment too warm and never leave it to soak. Let the garment dry flat.</p>

<p><strong>ABOUT THE YARN:</strong> <br />DROPS Baby Merino is spun from 100% merino wool fibers (19,5 micron) from free-range animals in South Africa and South America. A super soft and itch-free wool yarn, it is perfectly suited for delicate baby skin. The yarn is also superwash treated which makes it machine washable and ideal for daily use.</p>

<p>The yarn is spun from multiple thin strands, which gives extra elasticity, and this special construction makes it extra important to treat the garment right: Make sure that you knit with the correct gauge and rather use a tight gauge, than too loose. Don&#8217;t wash your garment too warm and never leave it to soak. Let the garment dry flat.</p>

<p>The yarn is cable spun, which means the stitches will be clearly defined, and the result achieved will be neat and even.</p>

<p>If you enjoy classic colorwork designs like Fair Isle, dyeing your own color combinations can take your knitting to a new level. Imagine being able to control every nuance of color as you plan your sweater. It’s a magical experience. A really fun technique is to dye this yarn in a long self-striping sequence and then knit it with a solid color of Palette in a slip stitch pattern that creates faux Fair Isle - simple knitting that only looks like you were working several colors at the same time. This yarn also felts very well because it has not been bleached.</p>

<p>Sally Fox&#8217;s farm is unique in its sole dedication to creating raw materials to make textiles (rather than food), and to grow them, both wool and cotton, organically. To grow materials for the specific purpose of making textiles, rather than for industrial uses or bedding, means spending much more time tending to fine details; the length of the fiber, cleanliness, and yield, so that the materials work well with the machinery, and will make a long-lasting and beautiful shirt or sweater. Sally has given great care to raising the sheep used in Pioneer, in turn, making a beautiful base for which we could make this yarn.</p>

<p>This yarn is the first, in hopefully a long line of yarn made with California wool. It forms the basis of The California Wool Project, our attempt to revitalize the California wool industry. Last year, in Northern California, over 8000 pounds of wool fleece was discarded. In asking ourselves how we could participate, we created our 1st yarn line, Pioneer, in hopes of many more, made with California wool. Our goal is to support farmers, US mills, and to create a yarn, year after year, which yields 5 sts per inch for the perfect sweater.</p>",TRUE,a-verb-for-keeping-warm-pioneer,4.65,60,279,,,160,1,5,5,2125,12,,329,252,5,"Page created: April 29, 2013Last updated: April 30, 2013…"

<p><strong>ABOUT THE YARN:</strong> <br />DROPS Lima is a 4 strands sport yarn, and a continuation of our great success and bestseller DROPS Nepal. The fibers are untreated, which means that they are only washed and not exposed to any chemical treatment prior to the dyeing. This highlights the fibers’ natural properties, while it provides also a better shape and texture quality.</p>

<p>Lima can be used with advantage for outdoor garments like classic Norwegian sweaters and sportswear, that are usually knitted tight for good shape stability. This hard wearing and durable wool quality is combined with the lovely and comfortable properties that the alpaca is known for. A sport yarn with a little bit more luxury!</p>

<p>DROPS Lima contains mixed colors, this means the wool is manufactured by carding the colors together before spinning, which gives it a mixed effect.</p>

<p>Made in Peru.</p>

<p>Hand Wash Only - this yarn will felt.</p>
